I've been on a tear with Microsoft Silverlight development, and now I've paused for a second and I'm wondering how can I test this stuff like I would with a [regular website](http://seleniumhq.org/)?

Well it turns out that I'm not the only one to think this. The [Silverlight Toolkit](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/) guys have included the [Silverlight Unit Test Framework](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut) in their distribution. I just got the bits installed, and I'll be trying it out shortly so hold tight for some future posts on getting tests built for Silverlight apps.

[This](http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2008/03/silverlight2-unit-testing/) is the first tutorial that I'm going to look at, since it goes through the details of hooking into the UI. Some of the other tutorials don't go into this.
