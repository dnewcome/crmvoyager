Most of the time, when programming against the Microsoft CRM Web service, we get reasonable error messages. However, on occasion we get the inscrutable "Generic SQL Error". I used to solve these by trial and error or intuition, but it turns out that there is better way.

Using SQL Server profiler can give us the answers that we are looking for. Check out [this blog post](http://www.avanadeblog.com/xrm/2011/04/troubleshooting-crm-generic-sql-error.html) for the details. Cheers.
