Like me, I'm sure that many of you are consultants who have clients running on a trial version of the CRM software. Also, like me, you probably have a lot of CRM installations for testing.

Here is how you can update the product key in Microsoft CRM 2011. Get the new key from the client if it is a retail key that they purchased or grab a key from your MSDN subscription if it is one of your testing instances. Once you have the key, just open up the CRM Deployment Manager and look for the option hightlighted below:

Enter the key in the pop up window and enjoy life again!
