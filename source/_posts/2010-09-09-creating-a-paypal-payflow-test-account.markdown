Several of our clients use PayPal as their payment gateway, so we have some general library code that deals with the PayPal payment gateway (PayFlow Pro).

In order to test our our code, of course we needed a sandbox account on the PayPal servers. However, it is not obvious how this works. Fortunately, I came across [this post](http://www.richardcastera.com/2009/10/13/how-to-create-a-sandbox-paypal-payflow-account/) that describes how to get a test account set up. It is a bit counterintuitive, but you go through the signup process for a full account and just abort at the last step.

Hopefully this post adds some weight to this guy's post (It worked great for me).
