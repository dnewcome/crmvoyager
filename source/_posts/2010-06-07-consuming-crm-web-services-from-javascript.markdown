I ran across a Javascript library today called [MSCRM 4.0 Web Service Toolkit ](http://danielcai.blogspot.com/2010/01/crm-web-service-javascript-toolkit.html)for making calls to CRM from Javascript. Apparently it was inpired by [this library](http://www.ercantuzun.com/post/Ascentium-CrmService-JavaScript-Library.aspx). This sure beats hand rolling soap calls, and is CRM specific, unlike some [other Javascript soap clients](http://www.guru4.net/articoli/javascript-soap-client/en/).
